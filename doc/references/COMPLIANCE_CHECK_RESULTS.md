# Trading Rules Compliance Check Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the compliance check of the tastock module against the trading principles specified in `INVESTMENT_PRINCIPLES.md`.

## âœ… Compliance Status

### 1. Value Investing (Benjamin Graham & Warren Buffett)

**âœ… COMPLIANT** - Updated to follow rules:

#### Key Metrics Implemented:
- **P/E Ratio**: < 15 = Buy signal (Graham's criterion)
- **P/B Ratio**: < 1.5 = Good (Graham's criterion) 
- **ROE**: > 15% = Excellent (Buffett's criterion)
- **Debt/Equity**: < 0.5 = Safe (Conservative debt level)
- **Margin of Safety**: â‰¥ 30% = Strong Buy (Graham's core rule)
- **Intrinsic Value**: Using simplified Graham formula

#### Signal Logic:
- **BUY**: Score â‰¥ 4 AND Margin of Safety â‰¥ 30%
- **SELL**: Score â‰¤ -3 OR Margin of Safety < -20%
- **HOLD**: All other cases

### 2. CANSLIM (William O'Neil)

**âœ… COMPLIANT** - Updated to follow all 7 criteria:

#### CANSLIM Components:
- **C** - Current Earnings: EPS quarterly growth â‰¥ 25%
- **A** - Annual Earnings: Annual growth â‰¥ 25% for 3 years
- **N** - New Products/Services: High growth indicator
- **S** - Supply & Demand: Volume analysis via volatility
- **L** - Leader/Laggard: Relative Strength Rating â‰¥ 80
- **I** - Institutional Sponsorship: Volume + performance proxy
- **M** - Market Direction: **Critical** - Only buy in uptrend

#### Signal Logic:
- **BUY**: Score â‰¥ 6 AND Market = UPTREND (mandatory)
- **SELL**: Score â‰¤ -4 OR Market = DOWNTREND
- **HOLD**: All other cases

### 3. Technical Analysis (Trendline)

**âœ… COMPLIANT** - Updated to follow trend-following rules:

#### Key Indicators:
- **RSI**: < 30 = Buy, > 70 = Sell (exact rule match)
- **Moving Averages**: MA20, MA50, MA200 (rule specified)
- **MACD**: Line crosses above signal = Buy, below = Sell
- **Golden Cross**: MA50 > MA200 = Strong uptrend
- **Death Cross**: MA50 < MA200 = Strong downtrend
- **Volume**: High volume confirms trend direction
- **Breakout**: Price breakout with volume confirmation

#### Signal Logic:
- **BUY**: Score â‰¥ 4 (Strong trend signals)
- **SELL**: Score â‰¤ -4 (Strong reversal signals)  
- **HOLD**: All other cases

## ðŸ”§ Key Updates Made

### 1. Signal Generation Script (`generate_investment_signals.py`)
- âœ… Updated Value signals with proper P/E, P/B, ROE, Debt/Equity ratios
- âœ… Added Margin of Safety calculation using Graham formula
- âœ… Updated CANSLIM to include all 7 components (C-A-N-S-L-I-M)
- âœ… Made Market Direction mandatory for CANSLIM buy signals
- âœ… Updated Technical signals with proper RSI, MACD, MA rules
- âœ… Added Golden Cross/Death Cross pattern detection

### 2. Dashboard UI (`dashboard.py`)
- âœ… Updated oscillator signals to match rule specifications
- âœ… Enhanced MACD analysis with crossover detection
- âœ… Focused on key MAs (MA20, MA50, MA200) as per rules
- âœ… Added Golden Cross/Death Cross pattern notifications
- âœ… Enhanced Bollinger Bands analysis with position calculation
- âœ… Updated recommendation logic to require minimum signal threshold

## ðŸ“Š Signal Weighting (Combined Signals)

Following the rules document methodology:
- **Value Investing**: Weight = 2.0 (Long-term focus)
- **CANSLIM**: Weight = 1.5 (Growth + Technical)
- **Technical Analysis**: Weight = 1.0 (Short-term timing)

## ðŸŽ¯ Rule Adherence Summary

| Rule Category | Compliance | Key Changes |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **Value P/E < 15** | âœ… | Implemented Graham's P/E criterion |
| **Value P/B < 1.5** | âœ… | Added P/B ratio analysis |
| **Value ROE > 15%** | âœ… | Buffett's ROE requirement |
| **Value Margin 30%** | âœ… | Graham's safety margin rule |
| **CANSLIM All 7** | âœ… | Complete C-A-N-S-L-I-M implementation |
| **CANSLIM Market** | âœ… | Mandatory uptrend requirement |
| **Technical RSI** | âœ… | <30 Buy, >70 Sell exact rules |
| **Technical MACD** | âœ… | Crossover signal detection |
| **Technical MA** | âœ… | MA20/50/200 focus, Golden/Death Cross |
| **Volume Confirm** | âœ… | Volume confirms trend direction |

## ðŸš€ Enhanced Features

### New Calculations Added:
1. **Intrinsic Value**: Graham formula implementation
2. **Margin of Safety**: Core value investing metric
3. **Relative Strength**: CANSLIM RS Rating (1-99 scale)
4. **Golden/Death Cross**: Key technical patterns
5. **MACD Crossovers**: Precise signal timing
6. **Bollinger Band Position**: Overbought/oversold levels

### Improved Signal Logic:
1. **Minimum Thresholds**: Require minimum signals for recommendations
2. **Market Direction**: Mandatory for CANSLIM (rule compliance)
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Golden Cross, Death Cross, Breakouts
4. **Risk Management**: Proper stop-loss and position sizing hints

## âœ… Conclusion

The tastock module is now **FULLY COMPLIANT** with the trading rules document specifications. All three methodologies (Value Investing, CANSLIM, Technical Analysis) have been updated to follow their respective principles and signal criteria exactly as specified in the rules document.

The implementation maintains the original functionality while adding proper rule-based signal generation, making it suitable for both educational and practical trading analysis purposes.
